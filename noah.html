            <p>i bought this van in september 2023 with 311k km, i sold it in july 2025 with 345k km.<br/>
                it was one of the best vehicles i have owned. its utility let me do a lot of things i <br/>
                couldnt have done with a normal car. i did more "truck stuff" with this van than most <br/>
                do with their actual trucks.
            </p>

            <p>some issues i had where rust, a failing door lock actuator, and some leaking power steering hoses.</p>

            <h3>Fun Story:</h3>

            <p>a fun thing is that this van was manufactured in windsor, ontario, which is where i was born and <br/>
                and lived for a while. i have seen the (outside of) the factory, and i have family members who worked <br/>
                worked in that factory on the assembly lines building these vans.

            <p>I bought this car in jan 2020 at 290k km, i sold it in september 2023 with 340k km.<br/>
                very reliable car, never failed to start. i got it for cheap because it was very worn out <br/>
                and it needed a lot of work, but it still ran ok. i learned a lot about auto repair from <br/>
                working on this car. the guy i sold it to, bought it for his daughter to drive, and it was still <br/>
                in late 2024.

            <h3>Fun Story:</h3>

            <p>Due to a small manufacturing defect in the motor during manufacturing, these motors (1st gen 1ZZ-FE) where <br/>
                VERY prone to burning tons of oil, especially if you skipped oil changes or the motor had high milage. <br/>
                i used to always carry some extra oil, and check the oil every time i got gas. i would need to top up the <br/>
                oil about a Liter every 2-3 times i got gas because it burned so much!

            <p>bought this car in the summer of 2019 at 170k km, my second car i owned. it was a nice cute little car. it played a little <br/>
                when you started the car. this was the first car that i had really worked on, and the first car i installed a stereo in. <br/>
                in all honestly it was a all around average but comfortable and familar car. i sold it in jan 2020 with 185km because i thought the <br/>
                the transmission was starting to go on it.

            <h3>Fun Story:</h3>

            <p>when i bought this car, i was living in edmonton and driving back to red deer every weekend for 2 months, then i moved back to <br/>
                red deer, then spent every weekend driving up to stony plain from red deer, so i put a ton of miles on this car.
            </p>

            <p>i had only all-seasons on the car, and one friday night in november 2019 i was driving to stony plain and got stuck in a really bad <br/>
                snow storm, and couldnt see 3 feet past my hood. i was going to turn around but didnt want to get stuck on a off ramp or overpass, <br/>
                so i kept driving all the way to stony plain, doing 60 or 70 km/ph the whole way.
